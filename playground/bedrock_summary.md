Topic: Modern-Syntax.md
Summary:
This article discusses modern JavaScript syntax, including the spread operator, destructuring operator, shorthand syntax, and arrow functions. The spread operator is used to expand an iterable into a list, while the destructuring operator is used to pick values from an array or object and assign them to individual variables. Shorthand syntax includes the ternary operator, the "OR" operator, the null-ish coalescing operator, and the optional chaining operator. Arrow functions are a concise way to define functions, particularly useful for callback functions.

Topic: Array Methods in Javascript
Summary:
This article discusses various array methods in Javascript, including .map(), .forEach(), .filter(), .find(), .findIndex(), .reduce(), .some(), .every(), .slice(), and .splice(). It provides examples and explanations for each method, highlighting their usage, syntax, and differences.

Topic: Object Methods in JavaScript
Summary:
This article discusses object methods in JavaScript, including Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries(), and Object.assign(). It explains how these methods can be used to perform various operations on objects, such as getting all keys, values, and key-value pairs, and copying content from one object to another. The article provides examples and usage for each method, demonstrating their applications in different scenarios.

Topic: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming
Summary:
This article explores the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript. It explains how synchronous programming executes code sequentially, blocking subsequent tasks until the current one completes, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to execute concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness in applications. The article discusses the problems that can arise from synchronous programming, such as blocking other tasks, and how asynchronous programming can be used to efficiently handle long-running tasks while keeping the UI responsive to the user. It also provides examples of asynchronous tasks, such as sending a request to a server, reading a file from disk, and accessing devices like camera, webcam, etc.

Topic: Callbacks in JavaScript
Summary:
This article discusses callbacks in JavaScript, including their definition, usage, and potential pitfalls. It explains how callbacks are used in asynchronous programming, providing examples of event handlers and XHR requests. The article also discusses the downsides of callbacks, such as the difficulty of reading and understanding code with many nested callbacks, and the formation of the

Topic: Promise in JavaScript
Summary:
This article introduces Promises in JavaScript, a feature introduced in ES6 to handle asynchronous operations. Using a real-world analogy of an ice-cream shop, we explore how Promises work and their role in managing tasks that take an uncertain amount of time to complete. We discuss how Promises, like a promise between two ice-cream shop staff, represent a future value that may or may not be available yet. This understanding provides a foundation for writing clean, efficient asynchronous JavaScript code. The article covers the basics of Promises, including the Promise object, .then(), .catch(), and .finally() methods, and promise chaining.

Topic: Async/Await in Javascript
Summary:
This article explores the async/await syntax in JavaScript, which simplifies working with asynchronous operations. It discusses how the async keyword ensures a function always returns a Promise, and how await can be used to pause execution until that Promise is resolved. The article compares examples with and without async/await to demonstrate how this syntax can make asynchronous code more readable and easier to reason about. Main topics include: async keyword, await keyword, asynchronous operations, Promise, synchronous code.
